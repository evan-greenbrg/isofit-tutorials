Warning from routine RM_EM:  For Segment No.    2 and Correlated-k/Line-By-Line interval No.    2 of line-of-sight No.    1,
                             the segment thermal emission    (  3.267738E-15 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1) exceeds the DISORT emitted
                             plus scattered thermal radiance ( -4.658208E-14 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)!  This tends to occur at
                             high altitudes, where scattering contributions are small.  The thermal scattered radiance
