Warning from routine RM_EM:  For Segment No.    3 and Correlated-k/Line-By-Line interval No.    2 of line-of-sight No.    1,
                             the segment thermal emission    (  1.193510E-15 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1) exceeds the DISORT emitted
                             plus scattered thermal radiance ( -4.422503E-14 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)!  This tends to occur at
                             high altitudes, where scattering contributions are small.  The thermal scattered radiance

Warning from routine RM_SSS:  For segment no.   15 of line-of-sight no.    1,  the single scatter solar radiance (  3.307190E-09 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)
                              was found to exceed the DISORT segment single plus multiple scatter solar radiance (  2.890496E-09 W CM-2 SR-1 / CM-1)!
