This example comes from calibration efforts for AV3 over Ivanpah.

NOTE: This example includes a single demo spectra and a severely limit lut.nc file. The lut.nc inlcuded here only includes two grid points.
Because the lut.nc is so limited, this example should never be used for actual calibration. We only use this data to test the wavelength calibration functionality of ISOFIT.
